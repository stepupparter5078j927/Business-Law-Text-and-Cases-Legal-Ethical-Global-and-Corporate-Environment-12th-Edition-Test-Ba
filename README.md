The first text to implement an undergraduate-oriented pedagogy with traditional law school-like content, Business Law continues to set the standard for excellence. The text combines the benefits of a black letter law approach with a strong student orientation, making the law accessible, interesting, and relevant for readers. The cases, content, and features of the 12th Edition have been thoroughly updated to represent the latest developments in business law. An excellent assortment of included cases ranges from precedent-setting landmarks to important recent decisions, and ethical, global, and corporate themes are integrated throughout. In addition, numerous critical-thinking exercises challenge students to apply what they've learned to real-world issues, and the text offers an unmatched range of support materials--including innovative online teaching and learning resources. It's no wonder that Business Law is used by more colleges and universities than any other business law text.
